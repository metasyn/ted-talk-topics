      "> tf\u2013idf, short for term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Variations of the tf\u2013idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query. tf\u2013idf can be successfully used for stop-words filtering in various subject fields including text summarization and classification."
